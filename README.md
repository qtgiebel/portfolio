# Portfolio Admin Tool

---

## Problem Statement
I have an art portfolio website, but the only way to update the art on the site is to directly edit the HTML files. To solve this I am building an admin tool and adding dynamic html functionality to the site. 

## MVP
Be able to update the images shown in my portfolio.

Be able to control who has access to view the admin tool and make changes to the portfolio.
